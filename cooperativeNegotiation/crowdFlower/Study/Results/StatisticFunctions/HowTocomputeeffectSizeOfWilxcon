Ho to interpret the Wilcoxon signed rank test:
Test Statistics is called "V"
1. V = The number of positifs rankings 
see http://cerim.univ-lille2.fr/fileadmin/user_upload/statistiques/michael_genin/Cours/Tests_statistiques/Tests_non-parametriques_printable.pdf (diapo 38)
2. Calculate Z in order to be able to compute the effect side (see diapo 42-43)
3. 
the effect size = z/ square(N)
N is the the size of the number of observations.
