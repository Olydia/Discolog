  >     User says "Let's go to the Il pinocchio restaurant. It's a lively, affordable Italian restaurant on the south side."
    Bob says "I don't like restaurants on the south side, let's choose something else."
    User says "Let's go to a restaurant on the west side."
    Bob says "Do you like restaurants on the north side?"
    User says "Let's go to the Caffe ditalia restaurant. It's a romantic, expensive Italian restaurant on the north side."

Hatem: In this experience the person called me telling me that there was an error becuase Bob proposed something and that she couldn't accept. 
But it wasn't really a problem because Bob just accepted what she proposed earlier.
But the form of the sentence is not clear, even me at first didn't understand what happened
