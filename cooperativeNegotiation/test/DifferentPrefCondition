#I like the dominant agent strategy, chinese was refuse but still he proposed the "dragon dor" restaurant which is chinese... Agent 2 ignores this proposal.
#Thus, the dominant negotiate on each criterion of the restaurant "dragon dor" and made the agent 2 accepts it in the end. 
#(We can clearly see that agent 2 made concessions while agent 1 no).

#(the second restaurant proposal is a Japanese restaurant because the agent 2 doesn't like Chinese food)
#However, he refuses to make other concessions and leads the dialogue.
