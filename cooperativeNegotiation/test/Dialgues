Dialogues I like:
----------------------------------------------------------------
	Initpref(Agent1) = model1 -Init pref(Agent2) = model 3 
	dom(Agent1)=0.9, dom(Agent2) = 0.4
----------------------------------------------------------------

Agent1 says "Let's go to a Chinese restaurant."
Agent2 says "I don't like Chinese restaurants, let's choose something else."
Agent1 says "Let's go to the Dragon dor . Its a quiet, cheap Chinese restaurant in the II arrondissement."
Agent2 says "Do you like Italian restaurants?"
Agent1 says "I don't like Italian restaurants."
Agent2 says "Do you like Mexican restaurants?"
Agent1 says "Let's go to the Dragon dor . Its a quiet, cheap Chinese restaurant in the II arrondissement."
Agent2 says "Do you like Mexican restaurants?"
Agent1 says "I don't like Mexican restaurants."
Agent2 says "Do you like French restaurants?"
Agent1 says "Let's go to a cheap restaurant."
Agent2 says "Okay, Let's go to a cheap restaurant."
Agent1 says "Let's go to a restaurant in the II arrondissement."
Agent2 says "Okay, Let's go to a restaurant in the II arrondissement."
Agent1 says "Let's go to the Dragon dor . Its a quiet, cheap Chinese restaurant in the II arrondissement."
Agent2 says "Okay, Let's go to the Dragon dor restaurant."

I like the submissive agent strategy, chinese was refuse but still he proposed the "dragon dor" restaurant which is chinese ... Agent 2 ignores this proposal.
Thus, the dominant negotiate on each criterion of the restaurant "dragon dor" and made the agent 2 accepts it in the end. 
(We can clearly see that agent 2 made concessions while agent 1 no).
