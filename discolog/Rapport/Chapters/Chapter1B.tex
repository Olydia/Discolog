\lhead{Chapter 2. \emph{Background}}
Planning is among the oldest fields of Artificial Intelligence: it was introduced in the 60s when researchers began considering automated reasoning about actions and changes. The goal of planning is, given a set of actions that describe transitions between states, to find a plan, i.e. a series of actions to go from an initial state to a specific goal. Such AI planners are used to solve real world problems by reasoning on a model of the world. It has many applications in Robotics \cite{shin1986dynamic}, Logistics \cite{crainic2009models}. ect. %

% In this chapter we will present the domain of application we will then formally deﬁne the problem we attempt to solve and finally discuss related works. 
\section{Classical and linear planning}
STRIPS \cite{fikes1972strips} is the first major AI planner. It considers domain knowledge, i.e. a representation of the real world, as a triple: 
\textit{D = (S, A, $\gamma$)}, 
with \textit{S} a set of states, \textit{A} a set of actions and \textit{$\gamma$: S $\times$ A $\rightarrow$ S}, a transition function that maps an initial state and action to the resulting state after performing the action. STRIPS assumes that the actions in the model are deterministic and discrete in time.
Each state \textit{s $\in$ S}  is a conjunction of positive literals. The world is monotonous (i.e. non-represented literals are false in the state).
Each action \textit{a $\in$ A} is of the form \textit{A (P, AL, DL)} with:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]	\textit{A} the action symbol composed by a set of terms (e.g. \textit{move(X,Y,Z)} to represent the action that moves object \textit{X} from location \textit{Y} to location \textit{Z});
\item[-]	\textit{P} is the precondition of the action, i.e. a conjunction of positive literals that must be true before the execution of the action;
\item[-]	\textit{AD} and \textit{DL} define respectively the add list and the delete list. The former is a set of positive literals added to the current state after the action execution and the later represents the positive literals removed from the state after the action execution.
\end{itemize}
A planning problem is defined as a triple \textit{P $=$ $<$D, si, sg$>$} with \textit{D} the domain knowledge, \textit{si $\in$S} the initial state and \textit{sg $\in$S} the goal state. A solution to P is a plan $\pi$, i.e. a sequence of actions a1,.., an $\in$ An such that \textit{$\gamma$ (Si, $\pi$)$\rightarrow$ Sg} (starting from the initial state, the plan leads to the goal state).

Several methods exist to solve a STRIPS planning problem. It has been proved \cite{bylander1994computational} that solving a planning problem in STRIPS is \textbf{PSPACE} complete. Several heuristics have been developed to find solutions in reasonable time. The initial STRIPS mean-end planner relied on a simple backward chaining search in the state space. In the 90s, most research focused on searching the plan-space (e.g. \cite{crainic2009models}). More recent approach such as GRAPHPLAN\cite{blum1997fast} and O-plan \cite{currie1991plan} propose to convert the planning problem to a different structure (e.g. a graph) for better performance. STRIPS was the foundation of several later works such as PDDL\cite{mcdermott1998pddl}, , etc and there still exists an active research field to find better (and faster) planning algorithms.
\section{HTN planning }
To work properly, the planner requires that the STRIPS problem is provided with a complete model of the domain knowledge, i.e. that the STRIPS representation corresponds to the real world situation. This modeling requires significant knowledge-engineering effort: one of the major difficulties with STRIPS is that all actions are at the same atomic level. As the considered problems become more and more complex, describing all these actions independently turns out to be an impossible task. This is the reason why new models have been proposed. Hierarchical Task Networks (HTNs) are probably the most commonly used model for planning since the 2000’s %[15]. 
\subsection{Overview of HTN}
A HTN or Hierarchical Task Network can be thought of AND$/ $OR tree structure (see Fig.1.1) where the root node expresses the task to be achieved. Tasks \textit{(T)} and recipes \textit{(R)} are alternatives nodes at each level in the tree.


Tasks nodes are OR nodes whose children are recipes that can be used to decompose the respective task into more primitive subtasks. Recipes nodes are AND nodes because the children of the recipe are a set of partially or fully ordered tasks resulting from using a recipe to decompose a task, all of which must be performed when applying the recipe to decompose a task.
Non-leaf node tasks represent compound tasks that need to be decomposed by a recipe and the leaf nodes are primitive tasks that can be directly executed. 
Each node has a set of zero or more modeling specification depending on the HTN modeling. These modeling specifications are \textit{pre-conditions, post-conditions} and \textit{applicability conditions}. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Applicability conditions: is the modeling specification of recipe’s nodes which helps the HTN choosing the appropriate decomposition if there is more than one.
\end{itemize}
	The task nodes haves two types of modeling specifications:  
\begin{itemize}
	\item	Preconditions: Specify when a task can be executed, so no task will start until all of its preconditions are satisfied.
	\item Postconditions: Specify when a task execution success or fails, in fact a task execution is considered as complete when its post-conditions are satisfied
	
\end{itemize}

\subsection{HTN formalism}
We start the HTN formalism by the presentation of HTN compound namely tasks and recipes. 

\subsubsection{Task formalism}
Tasks are expressions of the form T (PC, EC) where T is a symbol defining the task name. PC is the preconditions and PC is postcondition modeled as set of literals. We denote two types of tasks; compound task or non-primitive task and primitive task or action. For example figure \ref{HTN example representation} represents a compound task \textit{Move (Obj, Room1, Room2, Door}) which is decomposed into three primitive tasks \textit{\{ Pick-up (Obj), Walk (Room1, Room2, Door), Put-down(Obj)\}}.

\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics [width=.75\columnwidth]{Pictures/example.png}
	\caption{\label{HTN example representation} HTN example representation}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{HTN Recipe formalism}
An HTN recipe is used for the decomposition of compound task and has the form of a triple \textit{R = (N, T, H)} where \textit{N} is the name of the recipe which is unique such that no two recipes can have the same name. \textit{T} is a non-primitive task performed with this recipe and \textit{H} is a task network containing the set of subtasks of \textit{T}  describing one way of performing the task \textit{T}.


Using the HTN components formalism, we present now the domain knowledge and the HTN problem planning.

\textit{The Domain knowledge D} is a list of all the recipes in the HTN needed to decompose the HTN tasks. \textit{D= [R1,…, Rn]}. Thus an HTN is a tree defined as a tuple \textit{M = $<$T, D$>$} where \textit{T} is the task network composed by all the tasks of the HTN and \textit{ D } is the domain knowledge. 

The planning problem \textit{P} is defined as a tree-tuple\textit{ P =$<I$, M, G$>$} where\textit{ I} is the initial state, \textit{M} is the domain problem defined by the HTN tree and \textit{G} is the goal task to achieve. \textit{G} belongs to the tasks of \textit{M} and the precondition of \textit{G }is true in \textit{I}. The problem is to find a plan that solves \textit{P}. HTN planning works by expanding tasks and resolving conflicts iteratively, until a conflict-free plan can be found that consists only of primitive tasks.


Planning proceeds using task decomposition that starts from the initial goal task \textit{G}, expands this task using a corresponding recipe \textit{R}, and breaks down the goal into sequence of simpler subtasks. This process is applied recursively until the planner reaches a sequence of fully ordered primitive tasks that can make a goal successful. Thus, the solution of the planning problem\textit{ P} is a plan\textit{ $\pi$ = [a1,.., an ]} is a sequence of primitive tasks  \textit{ai $\in$ M }, and \textit{i $\in $[1,n].}

The HTN planners are becoming popular in different domains where several systems were developed these recent years such as SHOP\cite{nau1999shop}, SIPE \cite{wilkins1988practical} or NOAH \cite{sacerdoti1975structure}. 


General purpose of planning as STRIPS and HTN relies on a complete model of the domain knowledge that means if the model is not complete the planner won’t be able to plan. This approach of planning is named Declarative representation. Such representation of HTN requires a full modeling of HTN domain knowledge. Each task in the HTN has at least one modeling specification that allows reasoning in planning. Despite the completeness of this representation, modeling such domain require significant knowledge-engineering effort if it is not impossible.
\section{Reactive HTNs}
\par Declarative approaches planning attempt to predict the future.  The planning is made in off-line phase that start from initial state to search for logical future states to reach a final goal state, using for that the modeling specifications in the domain knowledge. Once the plan is generated, the execution phase is launched in the environment. 
\par In contrast with this approach, reactive HTNs aboard an approach with no planning phase to predict the future states; instead, they compute just the next act in every instant. Moreover, because of the complexity of modeling a domain knowledge, reactive HTNs run through a hand-authored HTN with a procedural definition of the modeling specifications. Procedural definition means that all conditions can only be evaluated in the current state. 
\par The solution of a planning problem is to find a path through the HTN using recipe selection. Starting from the initial state and the goal task, The HTN incrementally generates a sequence of sub-goals by choosing recipes for decomposing tasks. The recipe is selected by the applicability condition at the state where this last can be evaluated. The modeling specifications are evaluated in the current state, if it returns the values true the HTN consider it as valid and continue the exploration of the HTN. However if the evaluation of any specification fails (returns false), the HTN execution fails and we say that the HTN reaches a dead end. This situation is considered as hard failure. The execution is considered as complete if primitive tasks that make the goal successful are reached. 
Reactive HTN are becoming very popular in the field of controlling complex artificial intelligent systems exist performing in dynamic environment such as Dialog with the Disco  system \cite{rich2009building} and RavenClaw \cite{bohus2003ravenclaw}.



\section{Plan execution, breakdown and recovery}
The declarative planners introduced before return a plan $\pi$ composed of a sequence of primitive tasks (actions), which is passed to the controller for the execution phase. 
The execution starts from the initial state and has to achieve the execution of all the actions of the plan to reach the goal state.  
The execution of a STRIPS action is valid if its preconditions match subsets of the current observed world state immediately before the action is executed. The effects the executed action are added to the resulting state and the deleted effects are removed from it.  


The HTN execution takes the STRIPS execution one step further by introducing the postcondition checks. As STRIPS primitive task (action) is applicable if its preconditions are valid in the current state of the world, in addition, the execution of the primitive task is considered as succeed only if its postconditions are part from the resulting state. 
Thus, the plan is a solution to a planning problem if it matches a subset of the current world state immediately after the last action in the plan is executed.


As the environment is dynamic, the controller monitors the environment at each execution step in order to prevent a breakdown. A breakdown occurs if any deviation from the steps defined in the constructed plan is detected, such deviation makes the executed plan invalid and the execution of plan stops. 
The breakdown is identified if the world changes in an unexpected way that causes the execution failure of an action. The failure can be caused by one of these situations:
\begin{itemize}
\item First, the action preconditions are no longer satisfied in the current state. For example, a robot that plans to walk to room1 to room2 through door1, arriving at door1 the wind blows and the door1 became close, this unexpected change invalidate the precondition of the action  that is the door must be open. 
\item	Second, the executed action leads to unexpected consequences, in this case the postconditions of the action are not satisfied.

\end{itemize}

\section{The problem}Reactive HTNs take the position of using no planning process to detects the future state, instead, the HTN plan only for the  next task  to be executed and based only on the current observable state.  In addition, the  valuation of modeling specification is optimistic. This execution approach can lead the HTN to a state where no decomposition or execution are possible, this state is then called dead end. In such case, we say that the HTN executor faces a breakdown.Because the procedural definition of the domain knowledge and the reactive formalism of the HTN, this later is unable to backtrack in order to find another way to achieve the goal task. Therefore, the HTN can no longer continue its execution and the goal is impossible to achieve.
