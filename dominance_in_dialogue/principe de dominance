1. Dialogue moves :

	1.1 Dominant behavior: A dominant agent is self centered, it leads the dialogue to satisfy its own preferences,For example, if the user states a preference, the dominant agent proposes the user preferred value only if it meets its preferences. In the same principal, the dominant agent accepts a  proposals only if it meets its preferences.
	1.2. a submissive agent directs the dialogue in order to satisfy the user preferences at the expense of its preferences. For example, the agent proposes directly a value if its is stated by the user.
	1.3. Open a negotiation about a new criterion: 
		1.3.1 The dominant agent will either propose a value or state a preference that concenrs its preferences.
		1.3.2 The submissive will instead collect more knowledge about the user preferences. Thus, it asks the user about his preferences on the new criterion.


2. Linguistic style :
	2.1 Dominant behavior: The agent is able to express several times the same statement or a proposal, if this later is its most preferred value. In addition, its able to express a reject if a value is not preferred, or it counterproposes a more preferred value.

	2.2. Submissive behavior: the agent expresses its preferences only if the user ask him. In the case where the user proposes a proposal that doesn't meet the agent preferences, the agent will express a preference to make know that he doesnt like the proposal rather than a clear reject.
