		\section{First Study: Perception of behaviors related to dominance}
The main objective of this study is to investigate the perception of people about the behavior related to dominance during a negotiation. Indeed, we implemented a conversational agent that car produce a dominant / submissive behavior as described in the section  during a negotiation. 

Bernstein (1980) argued that dominance relationships can never be assumed but must be demonstrated in each application. Therefore, we aim to validate the implemented behaviors by investigating a perceptual experiment in which participants have to determine the behaviors of two agents during a negotiation .
