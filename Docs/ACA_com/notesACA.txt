interpersonal circumplex theory

This means that two conversational partners are influencing
each other with their stance during a dialog.

friendly begets friendly and dominance begets submission
We implemented Leary’s interpersonal stance theory as a
computational model for interpersonal stance in a conversational
agent: LearIS.This agent is an affective conversational
turn-taking agent.

Ils présentent un agent virtuel qui peut jouer le rôle de suspect dans un jeu d'entraînement 
d'interrogatoire de police. Ils utilisent la théorie de circumplex interpersonnel pour modéliser le status de l'agent lors de l'interaction (interrogatoire)
Un stance manager est présenté pour réviser le statut de l'agent dans le circomplexe apres reception d'une utterance de l'utilisateur.
Une modélisation complémentaire du status est présenté. Sur la base des travaux de un acte dominant va générer un acte soumis
La stratégie de l'agent est basée sur la perception de son statut lors de l'interaction

IGaze: Studying reactive gaze behavior in
semi-immersive human-avatar interactions

We present IGaze, a semi-immersive human-avatar interaction
system

Gaze also serves as an indicator for mood, personality and status
Dominant strategy of gaze : Our dominant strategy consists
of maintaining eye contact while speaking and randomly changing from gazing
to averting while listening. More precisely, the avatar establishes and holds eye
contact when speaking, and after speaking, immediately looks away

Submissive strategy
. Our submissive strategy makes the avatar only look briefly
every now and then and immediately avert the gaze again. In the submissive
strategy, the avatar establishes eye contact when starting to talk but averts his
gaze immediately after eye contact.

Kipp and Gebhard [18] investigated different gaze strategies
to convey the intended degree of dominance and submission
The submissive character only looked briefly every now and then at the human interlocutor and immediately averted the
gaze again. On the contrary to the submissive character, the dominant character established and held eye contact when
speaking, and after speaking, immediately looked away

Exploring Interaction Strategies for Virtual Characters to Induce Stress in Simulated Job Interviews

Modéliser un recruteur virtuel qui joue un rôle de recruteur exigent. Ce dernier est modéliser pour avoir une personnalité forte et exprime des comportements de dominance 
The non-verbal behavior of the demanding
character is defined as: 1) show more space-taking
(dominant) gestures, 2) show facial expressions that can
be related to negative emotions (e.g. distress, anger, or
reproach), 3) using longer pauses to show dominance in
explanations and questions, and 4) show a dominant gaze
behavior. On the verbal level, comments and questions
are strict and contain very few politeness phrases.



we focus on the rules for dominant and friendly gestures (e.g.
dominant gestures are characterized with a large spatial
parameter) and posture feature (e.g.
tilt of the head on
a side with no gaze not averted).
The dominant
strategy follows Kipp and Gebhard's iGaze approach [18]. It consists of maintaining eye contact at the beginning of a
speaking or listening phase. First, the character establishes
and holds eye contact and after a first utterance, it looks
away for a short time.

social dominance
Bee et al [5] investigated the dominance perception of virtual character with varying head and eye gaze directions,
and found that a lowered head was perceived less dominant than a raised head.

This paper examines the interaction of verbal and nonverbal information for 
conveying social dominance in intelligent virtual agents

downward gaze was considered as less dominant.

Results indicate that linguistic agreeableness inversely affects the perception of dominance

Pollock and colleagues [6] investigated
how the combination of gaze and linguistic behaviors impacts the perception of social dominance. They found that
the linguistic expression of disagreeableness had a significant effect on dominance perception, but that extraversion did
not.

This work is complemented by a study conducted
by Ne and colleagues [21] who focused on the interactions between natural language and gestures.

Very relevant to the presented work is the recently created corpus of virtual character's non-verbal behaviors collected by users;
 categorized and prepared for further research by Ravent, Ochs, and Pelachaud [24].
They started by letting users relate non verbal behavior of a virtual character to its interpersonal
attitudes. Then, these data are analyzed with regard to how a social virtual character behaves in interactive situations.
One result of their work is a Bayesian network using these data to create a computational model of non-verbal behavior
depending on the interpersonal attitude of the character and its actual (social) intentions.



Dominant. The dominant attitude is mainly characterized by a negative facial
expression, the presence of head movements and arm gestures, the absence of
gaze avoidance, and an upward position of the head. The gestures are charac-
terized with a large spatial parameter and a strong power parameter.
Submissive. A submissive attitude is mainly characterized by a neutral facial
expression, head movements only (no arm gestures), and an downward position
of the head. For the gaze avoidance there is a little preference for the gaze at
value. Both spatial and power parameters receive a small value when the gestures
are activated.

Lance and Marsella [25] found that during gaze shifts head
pitch is significantly related to dominance. That is, head
turns upwards indicate high dominance and head turns
downwards indicate low dominance [25] Emotionally expressive head and body movement during gaze shifts

Paper  :  The effect of an intelligent virtual agent’s nonverbal behavior with regard to dominance and cooperativity

Dominant: akimbo posture, crossing arms, sagittal head up, large radius
Submissive: neck-adaptor, arms open, sagittal head down, small radius

With regard to dominance perception, having the arms crossed and the akimbo position are the most affective gestures. 
Taking up more space by executing a gesture with large radius was not perceived as more dominant than the other gestures.

Moreover, self-touch with the hand in the neck and the gaze downward, evokes the most submissive perception and differs significantly from the other gestures.
