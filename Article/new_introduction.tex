% The testflow support page is at:
% http://www.michaelshell.org/tex/testflow/



% Note that the a4paper option is mainly intended so that authors in
% countries using A4 can easily print to A4 and see how their papers will
% look in print - the typesetting of the document will not typically be
% affected with changes in paper size (but the bottom and side margins will).
% Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify correct handling of
% both paper sizes by the user's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.
%
\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{blindtext, graphicx}
% Add the compsoc option for Computer Society conferences.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
% \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
% or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
% will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
% driver is specified.
% \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
% declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
% and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
% every instance of \includegraphics
% \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	\section{Introduction}
	

	
\par Automatic planning is an important field of controlling artificial agents in complex and dynamic environments where research built two different approaches. The first one is symbolic planning: this approach consists in constructing a complete symbolic and logical model of the environment that allows the agent to reason about this model and define a complete plan to carry out its goals.  
The most popular architecture used to describe the environment is the hierarchical architecture HTN (Hierarchical Taks Network) \cite{erol1996hierarchical}, which allows a recursive decomposition of complex goals into sub-goals or primitive actions. The HTN architecture eases the design of the environment and gives more expressiveness. Multiple planning systems using this approach were developed such as SHOP \cite{nau1999shop}, SIPE \cite{wilkins1988practical} or NOAH \cite{sacerdoti1975structure}. Symbolic planning assumes that the environment is fully defined. By consequence,  the agent is able to predict all the possible situations an to plan in advance. Nevertheless, it becomes clear that authoring a complete representation of a dynamic and complex environment such as simulation of human behavior \cite{conte1998mas} or the definition of dialog systems \cite{allen2002human} requires significant  knowledge-engineering effort \cite{zhuo2009learning}, and even reveals to be impossible \cite{maes1990designing}. However, with incomplete knowledge the agent cannot anticipate the future and the generated plan might be not executed as expected. Therefore, if at any point of the execution the plan breaksdown (i.e action execution fails), the planner has to stop the execution and build another plan that achieves the agent's goals. Such operation might be costly in terms of time and resources. 

\par Because of these limitations, another planning approach called reactive planning was proposed \cite{firby1987investigation}. Reactive planning avoids long-term prediction and leaves all the planning during the execution phase: the agent plans only for the next step to be executed from the current defined state of the environment. Thus, it can adapt the next step according to the observed changes. The main advantage of reactive planning systems is they don't need a complete definition of the environment. Instead, they aim to define the policy of the agent in its environment by running through a pres-authored HTN structure with  procedural  knowledge. Procedural knowledge defines conditions in the HTN domain knowledge as black-box procedures (for exmaple : JavaScript code) that contains no logical information (i.e no symbolic knowledge). This type of reactive HTN  eases the design, reduce the complexity of planning and still can cope with complex dynamic environments \cite {brom2005hierarchical}. They are used in numerous application domains, such as dialog systems \cite{bohus2003ravenclaw} and simulating human behavior \cite{brom2005hierarchical}.
\par Nevertheless, breakdowns can still appear in reactive planning. An action execution can fail and leads the HTH to a state where no action can be applicable to achieve the goal. 
In such situation, the agent has to stop and think about a new solution to reach its goal. However, without symbolic knowledge, the agent has nothing to reason about. The execution thus stops and the agent cannot recover from its breakdown.

 \par  In order to deal with this limitation, we propose in this paper to extend reactive HTNs with a linear symbolic planner. For this reason, we propose to  the HTN author to extend the procedurale konwledge of the HTN with some symbolic knowledge that allows the symbolic planner to  compute local recovery plans. We study the capacity of such  model to recover from breakdowns in reactive planning. 

\par In section 2, we briefly present existing works in this domain. In section 3 we formalize the proposed solution \textit{Discolog} and describe its implementation. Section 4, presents the expriments and discusses the obtained solutions. At the end, we discuss the futures works to validate and extends our solution to differents domains and uses.

\section{Related works}
 reactive planning becomes very popular in AI such in controlling mobile agents \cite{beaudry2005reactive} or simulating human behaviour \cite{bryson2001modularity}.  Nevertheless, As reactive planning is used for highly dynamic environements it presents certain limits as discussed below: 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item C. Brom \cite{brom2005hierarchical} proposes in his work an educational toolkit for prototyping human-like behaviour. the proposed reative architecture was based on the work proposed in \cite{bryson2001modularity}. Nevertheless, this reactive planning system faces some limits such as : 
 impossibility to add new goals during the execution or inhebit an undesirable subtask.unatural switching between behaviour. 
  
 \item R. James Firby  \cite{firby1987investigation} 
 \end{itemize}
 
 
 
%A great deal of research has been done in the field of planning. Most of theses works were interested in constructing symbolic planning systems especially symbolic HTNs that include plan recovery from breakdwons and replanning. A common approach \cite{ayan2007hotride} \cite{van2005plan} \cite{warfield2007adaptation}. (revoir la phrase) is in addition to the plan, the HTN procduces a graph that captures the causal links between the HTN's tasks. Therefore, if during  plan execution, a breakdown occurs, the HTN uses the structure to detect all the tasks compromised by the failure and therefore needs to be repaired. The HTN is called to propose a local plan recovory to repair the failed taks instead of replanning from the scartch. Nevertheless, theses systems are always dependent to the HTN and inhirit its limitations. For example, if the HTN cannot propose a plan recovery for the failed tasks then it has to replan from the scratch or blocked.  
%\par \cite{hayashi2006dynagent} proposes to construct a planning system applicated to musium tour guide. this planning system uses A* heurestic to define the most fiable plan. If this later still breakdwons it uses the heurstic to call other plans to recover from breakdwons.  
%
% In this last decate, there has been an interest on defineing reactive planning that can deal with high dynamic environments. Present articles in different field of IA and their solutions to handle limits of reactive planning. 

	\section{Discolog}
	\subsection{overview of the solution}
		present the concept of the hybrid planning system that include a reactive HTN and a simple linear planner: 
		exploit the similarity between some procedural procedure and symbolic knowledge  extend them to a symbolic formalism. 
		
		Describe the architecture of HTN and how to use it to integrate symbolic planning system. and propose to the HTN author to extends the boolean structure that approach a symbolic structure. 
		\subsection{Discolog architecture}
		1. Brief presentation of the main architecture of Disco + ref + STRIPS in prolog 
		
		
		Describe in detail with the pseudo code how Discolog detects a breakdwon, generate the candidates and propose a plan recovery: 
		
		
		1. How a breakdown is detected
		
		
		2. Use the algorithm to describe the plan recovery steps.
		
		
		2.1. Calculate candidates: Detect the failed task and all the tasks affected by the breakdwon
	
	
		2.2. How STRIPS constructs its domain knowledge, build a plan recovery and calaculates the best one.

	% You can push biographies down or up by placing
	% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
	% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
	% on the last page and whether or not the columns
	% are being equalized.
	
	%\vfill
	
	% Can be used to pull up biographies so that the bottom of the last one
	% is flush with the other column.
	%\enlargethispage{-5in}
	
	
	
	
	% that's all folks
